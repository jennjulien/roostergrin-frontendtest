ROOSTER GRIN MEDIA- FRONT END TEST

1. What technologies were used and why?
   Technologies I used:

1) HTML5
2) CSS3
3) Bootstrap
   I picked Bootstrap as my frontend framework. It helped me design and map out the project so I would be able to add the necessary designs. It also helped with adding a carousel and making this responsive for all devices.

2. Any struggles faced when developing wit technology you chose?
   Yes! I am so used to designing with just plain HTML & CSS so implementing Bootstrap was a bit challenging. But I just had to brush up on some lessons and remembered everything afterwards.

3. What you enjoyed most and why?
   I honestly enjoyed this entire project. It pushed me to learn more about web development/frontend development. It also made me learn some new things and new ways to make a web page. I definitely will be making more websites like this in the future cause it was fun playing around.
